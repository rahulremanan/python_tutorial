Once we have implemented this network, we will visualize the predictions generated by the neural network and compare it with a logistic regression model, in the form of classification boundaries. This workshop aims to provide an intuitive understanding of neural networks."

    "In practical code development, there is seldom an use case for building a neural network from scratch. Neural networks in real-world are typically implemented using a deep-learning framework such as tensorflow. But, building a neural network with very minimal dependencies helps one gain an understanding of how neural networks work. This understanding is essential to designing effective neural network models. Also, towards the end of the session, we will use tensorflow deep-learning library to build a neural network, to illustrate the importance of building a neural network using a deep-learning framework."

    "\n",
    "[The XOR gate is an interesting problem in neural networks](http://www.ece.utep.edu/research/webfuzzy/docs/kk-thesis/kk-thesis-html/node19.html). [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky) and [Samuel Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) in their book [ 'Perceptrons' (1969)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptrons_(book) showed that the XOR gate cannot be solved using a two layer perceptron, since the solution for a XOR gate was not linearly separable. This conclusion lead to a significantly reduced interest in[ Frank Rosenblatt's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt) perceptrons as a mechanism for building artificial intelligence applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these earliest work in AI were using networks or circuits of connected units to simulate intelligent behavior. Examples of this kind of work are called \"connectionism\". [After the publication of 'Perceptrons', the interest in connectionism significantly reduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter#The_abandonment_of_connectionism_in_1969), till the renewed interest following the works of [John Hopfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hopfield) and [David Rumelhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rumelhart).\n",
    "\n",
    "The assertions in the book 'Perceptrons' by Minsky was inspite of his thorough knowledge that the powerful perceptrons have multiple layers and that Rosenblatt's basic feed-forward perceptrons have three layers. In the book, to deceive unsuspecting readers, Minsky defined a perceptron as a two-layer machine that can handle only linearly separable problems and, for example, cannot solve the exclusive-OR problem. [The Minsky-Papert collaboation is now believed to be a political maneuver and a hatchet job for contract funding by some knowledgeable scientists](http://csis.pace.edu/~ctappert/srd2011/rosenblatt-contributions.htm). This strong, unidimensional and misplaced criticism of perceptrons essentially halted work on practical, powerful artificial intelligence systems that were based on neural-networks for nearly a decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 of this notebook explains how to build a very basic neural network in numpy. This perceptron like neural network is trained to predict the output of a [XOR gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate).\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider an input matrix with the entire training data, represented as set **_X_** and the corresponding labels, represented as set **_Y_**. \n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal machine learning model can be defined as a special type of [surjective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective_function) that maps the set **_X_**, which contains all the input elements **__x__**; to the set **_Y_**, which contains all the label elements **__y__**.\n",

    "\n",
    "An important result from the surjective function based definition of machine learning is that, they are not true universal function approximators; since the universe of all the mathematical operations cannot be expressed as a surjective function, due to [Cantor's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_paradox). \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the very high effectiveness of machine learning models in approximating a variety of practical problems, they are understandably mischaracterized as universal function approximators.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, from a practical stand-point; machine learning models do not have to satisfy the criteria of a true universal function approximator, to be useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the most commonly encountered phenomena in the universe can be treated as just a smaller subset of the universe of all the mathematical operations, machine learning models can be applied to approximate these phenomena very successfully. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, machine learning models are highly effective quasi or pseudo universal function approximators; capable of solving most, but not all problems in the universe of all mathematical operations.\n"

He is known for his work on connectionism, the incredible Mark 1 Perceptron. This notebook aims to remember the promise, the controversy and the resurgence of connectionism and neural networks as a tool in artificial intelligence.\n",

    "[Here is a brief biography of Frank Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt) (Via Wikipedia):\n",
    "\n",
    "Frank Rosenblatt was born in New Rochelle, New York as son of Dr. Frank and Katherine Rosenblatt. After graduating from The Bronx High School of Science in 1946, he attended Cornell University, where he obtained his A.B. in 1950 and his Ph.D. in 1956.\n",
    "\n",
    "He then went to Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in Buffalo, New York, where he was successively a research psychologist, senior psychologist, and head of the cognitive systems section. This is also where he conducted the early work on perceptrons, which culminated in the development and hardware construction of the Mark I Perceptron in 1960. This was essentially the first computer that could learn new skills by trial and error, using a type of neural network that simulates human thought processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rosenblatt’s research interests were exceptionally broad. In 1959 he went to Cornell’s Ithaca campus as director of the Cognitive Systems Research Program and also as a lecturer in the Psychology Department. In 1966 he joined the Section of Neurobiology and Behavior within the newly formed Division of Biological Sciences, as associate professor. Also in 1966, he became fascinated with the transfer of learned behavior from trained to naive rats by the injection of brain extracts, a subject on which he would publish extensively in later years.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1970 he became field representative for the Graduate Field of Neurobiology and Behavior, and in 1971 he shared the acting chairmanship of the Section of Neurobiology and Behavior. Frank Rosenblatt died in July 1971 on his 43rd birthday, in a boating accident in Chesapeake Bay.\n",
