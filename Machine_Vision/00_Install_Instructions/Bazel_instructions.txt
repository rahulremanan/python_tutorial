# Install Protocol-buffer before installing bazel:

# Get bazel installation source files:
# Note: A simple git clone won't work for newest versions of bazel since the developer build process now needs bazel.

$wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.25.3/bazel-0.25.3-dist.zip

$unzip -q -d bazel bazel-0.25.3-dist.zip

cd bazel

## Resume bazel build process ##

# Compile bazel from source:

$sudo ./compile.sh

# Copy the new binary from output/bazel to /usr/local/bin directory.

$sudo cp output/bazel /usr/local/bin/bazel

# Verify bazel installation:

$bazel
